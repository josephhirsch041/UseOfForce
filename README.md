# UseOfForce
A repo for code and data pertaining to Excessive use of force by police in the USA.
Until SMEs can be located I have to guess what features will be needed in order to answer the question, "Why are policing institutions in the USA unable to hire, train, and employ police officers that do not use excessive force?"

5/31/2020: An Excel spreadsheet will be used to gather data until I can have a discussion with someone from the lawn enforcement and or legal community on what excessive use of force is and how an organization goes about determining that it was used.
