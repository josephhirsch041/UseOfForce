# UseOfForce
A repo for code and data pertaining to excessive use of force by police in the USA.
Until SMEs can be located, I have to guess what features will be needed in order to answer the question, "Why are policing institutions in the USA unable to hire, train, and employ police officers that do not use excessive force?"

5/31/2020: An Excel spreadsheet will be used to gather data until I can have a discussion with someone from the law enforcement and or legal community on what excessive use of force is and how an organization goes about determining that it was used.

5/11/2020: I've discovered that there is a difference between an arrest report and a court document. Police arrest reports are not available to the general public. Court documents are. For the time being data that I gather 
will have to be court documents. The question that I am trying to answer also needs to be revised. It is now, "Do policing institutions in the USA have employees that use excessive use of force?" How is excessive use of force measured?

Use of force is not a standard that exists among all police departments. It is a department by department standard (http://useofforceproject.org/#review). 
Court record data must be relatable to the police department that made the arrest in order to create a relationship with that specific police department's use of force policy.
